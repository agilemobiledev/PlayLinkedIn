h2. PlayLinkedIn

This is a simple example webapp written using the Play! framework, scala, and the LinkedIn developer APIs.

The app also uses scribe-java to handle the oauth flow.

* Be sure to edit ApiKeys.scala and fill in the apiKey and secretKey you obtain from http://developer.linkedin.com, otherwise the app won't work*

h3. Installation

To create the Eclipse .classpath and .project file:
$ play eclipsify PlayLinkedIn

(I've found that the intellj files didn't work, so I create the .classpath and then import into IntelliJ
as external project.)

h4. Running
play run PlayLinkedIn

then go to http://localhost:7000

The debug port is 7002.

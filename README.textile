h2. PlayLinkedIn

This is a simple example webapp written using the Play! framework, scala, and the LinkedIn developer APIs.

The app also uses scribe-java to handle the oauth flow.

* Be sure to edit ApiKeys.scala and fill in the apiKey and secretKey you obtain from http://developer.linkedin.com, otherwise the app won't work*
